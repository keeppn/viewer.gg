# üéØ Quick Fix Summary - Discord Login Issue

## What Was Wrong
The Discord login was creating users successfully but immediately logging them out because the error handling code didn't have proper `return` statements.

## What Was Fixed
Added **3 critical return statements** in `web/src/store/authStore.ts`:

1. **Line ~86**: Return after user creation fails
2. **Line ~96**: Return after user creation succeeds (was already there)
3. **Line ~104**: Return after handling non-PGRST116 errors

## The Key Change
```typescript
// BEFORE (broken):
if (createError) {
  console.error('Error creating user:', createError);
  // ‚ùå No return - code continues and wipes user!
}

// AFTER (fixed):
if (createError) {
  console.error('Error creating user:', createError);
  set({ user: null, session, ... });
  return; // ‚úÖ Stop here, preserve session
}
```

## How To Test
1. Clear browser cache/cookies
2. Go to the login page
3. Click "Login with Discord"
4. Authorize the app
5. ‚úÖ You should stay logged in (not redirected to login)
6. ‚úÖ Check console for: "User created successfully: {user object}"

## What To Look For
- ‚úÖ "Creating new user record..." in console
- ‚úÖ "User created successfully: {object}" in console  
- ‚úÖ User stays logged in after OAuth redirect
- ‚úÖ User profile loads in the UI

## Files Changed
- `web/src/store/authStore.ts` (lines 45-104)

## Status
‚úÖ **FIXED** - Ready to test
