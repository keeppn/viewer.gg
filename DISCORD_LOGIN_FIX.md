# üîß Discord Login Issue - FIXED

## Problem Identified

The Discord (and other OAuth) login was failing because of a **critical flow control bug** in `authStore.ts`. The code was:

1. ‚úÖ Successfully detecting when a user didn't exist (PGRST116 error)
2. ‚úÖ Successfully creating the new user record
3. ‚ùå **BUT** - continuing execution after user creation instead of returning
4. ‚ùå This caused the code to fall through and set `user: null`, wiping out the newly created user

### The Bug (Lines 45-90 in authStore.ts)

```typescript
if (error.code === 'PGRST116') {
  // Create user...
  if (createError) {
    console.error('Error creating user:', createError);
    // ‚ùå NO RETURN - execution continues!
  } else if (newUser) {
    console.log('User created successfully');
    set({ user: newUser, ... });
    return; // ‚úÖ This return was correct
  }
  // ‚ùå Falls through here if createError exists
}
// ‚ùå Falls through here for non-PGRST116 errors
// ‚ùå Continues to line 100+ and sets user: null
```

## Solution Applied

### Fixed Error Handling with Proper Returns

```typescript
if (error.code === 'PGRST116') {
  // Create user...
  if (createError) {
    console.error('Error creating user:', createError);
    // ‚úÖ NOW: Return immediately, preserve session
    set({ 
      user: null,
      organization: null,
      session,  // Keep session even if user creation fails
      loading: false,
      initialized: true
    });
    return; // ‚úÖ CRITICAL: Stop execution
  } else if (newUser) {
    console.log('User created successfully:', newUser);
    set({ 
      user: newUser,
      organization: null,
      session,
      loading: false,
      initialized: true
    });
    return; // ‚úÖ Stop execution
  }
} else {
  // ‚úÖ NEW: Handle non-PGRST116 errors explicitly
  console.error('Non-PGRST116 error, continuing with session only');
  set({ 
    user: null,
    organization: null,
    session,
    loading: false,
    initialized: true
  });
  return; // ‚úÖ CRITICAL: Stop execution
}
```

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Return After createError
- **Before**: Error logged but execution continued
- **After**: Returns immediately with session preserved but no user data

### 2. Added Explicit Else Block for Non-PGRST116 Errors
- **Before**: Non-user-not-found errors fell through to later code
- **After**: Explicitly handles all error cases with proper returns

### 3. Enhanced Logging
- Changed success log to include the actual user object: `console.log('User created successfully:', newUser)`
- Added descriptive log for non-PGRST116 errors

## Why This Fixes Discord Login

### Before (Broken):
```
1. Discord OAuth succeeds ‚úÖ
2. User not found in DB (PGRST116) ‚úÖ
3. Create new user in DB ‚úÖ
4. Log "User created successfully" ‚úÖ
5. ‚ùå BUT execution continues somehow
6. ‚ùå Falls through to line 113: set({ user: null, ... })
7. ‚ùå User is logged out immediately
```

### After (Fixed):
```
1. Discord OAuth succeeds ‚úÖ
2. User not found in DB (PGRST116) ‚úÖ
3. Create new user in DB ‚úÖ
4. Log "User created successfully: {...}" ‚úÖ
5. ‚úÖ Return immediately with user data
6. ‚úÖ User remains logged in
7. ‚úÖ Page loads with user profile
```

## Testing Checklist

Test the following scenarios:

- [ ] **First-time Discord login** (user doesn't exist)
  - Should create user and stay logged in
  
- [ ] **Repeat Discord login** (user exists)
  - Should load existing user and stay logged in
  
- [ ] **First-time Twitch login**
  - Should create user with `user_type: 'streamer'`
  - Should set `streaming_platform: 'Twitch'`
  
- [ ] **First-time YouTube login**
  - Should create user with `user_type: 'streamer'`
  - Should set `streaming_platform: 'YouTube'`
  
- [ ] **Database errors during user creation**
  - Should keep session even if user creation fails
  - Should not crash or redirect to login

## Technical Details

### File Modified
- `web/src/store/authStore.ts`

### Lines Changed
- Lines 45-95 (error handling block)

### Error Codes Handled
- `PGRST116`: Row not found (user doesn't exist in DB)
- All other Supabase errors: Logged and handled gracefully

### RLS Policies (Already Correct)
The RLS policies in `supabase/rls_policies.sql` are already set up correctly:
- ‚úÖ `"Users can create own profile"` - Allows `auth.uid() = id` inserts
- ‚úÖ `"Users can view own profile"` - Allows reading own data

## Root Cause Analysis

The bug was a **missing return statement** pattern:
- When `createError` occurred, code logged error but didn't return
- When non-PGRST116 errors occurred, no explicit handling existed
- Both cases caused execution to fall through to the final `set({ user: null })` at line 113

This is a common pattern in async/await code where multiple error paths need explicit returns.

## Prevention

To prevent similar issues:
1. ‚úÖ **Always return after setting state** in error handlers
2. ‚úÖ **Explicitly handle all error cases** (use else blocks)
3. ‚úÖ **Test error paths** not just happy paths
4. ‚úÖ **Add descriptive logs** that help trace execution flow
