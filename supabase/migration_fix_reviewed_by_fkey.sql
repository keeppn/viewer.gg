-- Migration: Fix applications.reviewed_by foreign key constraint
-- Date: 2025-11-07
-- Issue: Unable to delete users who have reviewed applications due to missing ON DELETE behavior
-- Solution: Add ON DELETE SET NULL to preserve application data when reviewer account is deleted

-- Drop the existing foreign key constraint
ALTER TABLE applications 
DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS applications_reviewed_by_fkey;

-- Re-create the constraint with ON DELETE SET NULL
ALTER TABLE applications 
ADD CONSTRAINT applications_reviewed_by_fkey 
FOREIGN KEY (reviewed_by) 
REFERENCES users(id) 
ON DELETE SET NULL;

-- Verify the constraint was created correctly
-- (Optional: Run this separately to check)
-- SELECT 
--   tc.constraint_name, 
--   tc.table_name, 
--   kcu.column_name, 
--   ccu.table_name AS foreign_table_name,
--   ccu.column_name AS foreign_column_name,
--   rc.delete_rule
-- FROM information_schema.table_constraints AS tc 
-- JOIN information_schema.key_column_usage AS kcu

-- JOIN information_schema.constraint_column_usage AS ccu
